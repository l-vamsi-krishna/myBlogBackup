All the motivational videos look good, positive, and encouraging that you can do anything and be anything. The background music and words are so impactful that they enlighten your mood and you feel pumped up. But these feelings fade away in an hour or a day or a few days, and no one would be motivated for a lifetime. When you re-watch the video, you may or may not get the same feeling as earlier, or else they fade away again.

That’s because it is external motivation, it doesn’t mean they don’t work, you should instead look for motivation from the inside. This motivation from inside comes either with inspiration from someone/something, desires, curiosity, habits, goals, or many other things. Be cautious not to use comparison as a motivation factor.

Start with a small goal or habit and work towards it. In this process, you would get setbacks or get demotivated, at that time your motivation from inside suffers. Now videos that are an external source of motivation can help you get back on track, and those encouraging words can help you get to the goal you set. Once you have reached that small goal, your self-confidence will increase which again aids in the next goal you set.
